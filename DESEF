#What is the Disney Elementary School Education Foundation (DESEF)?

It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that is run by parent volunteers.  DESEF raises funds to provide important classroom programs and services that otherwise would not be available to our children.  In order to continue these vital programs, we are asking for your help with our 2014-15 Annual Fund Drive.

The Disney Ed Fund is requesting a contribution of $325.00 per student.  This is only $1.80 per school day!  Your tax deductible donation directly pays for the following programs at Walt Disney this year:
* Librarian
* Technology teacher
* Art program
•	iPads and laptops for student use
•	Classroom paraprofessionals
•	Dragon Academy academic intervention
•	Computer systems technician
•	Teacher preparation for new Common Core standards
•	Music program for TK & K students
•	Walt Disney TV (WDTV) program
•	Instructional materials
•	Lunch/recess supervisor
•	Recess enrichment, Scripps Spelling Bee, Odyssey of the Mind

In order to retain these important programs, we need your help.  The total cost of these programs is $226,433 for the 2014-15 school year.  This Annual Fund Drive is our biggest single fundraiser. Without your support, DESEF will not be able to fund these important programs and staff positions, and they will likely cease to exist at Walt Disney Elementary School.   

We also offer flexible payment options!  You can donate online right now in one lump sum or choose to have your credit card billed in installments.  Or you may pay by cash or check at our On-Site Registration/Picture Day.  We may also be able to accommodate other installment plan requests -- you can ask our On-Site registration staff about these other options.  In all cases, we ask that you give whatever amount you can afford.  Every dollar helps!  Please join your fellow Walt Disney Elementary parents and help us achieve 100% participation – at any donation level you choose!  We thank you for your support!

These programs and services only exist because of your support of DESEF.
